    back onto fast local storage and are called from code running on the
    threadpool, never on the event loop (docs/adr/0002). Workers never see
    this port — the FastAPI parent owns all job state.

    Three contracts every implementation must honor:

    * **Token scoping.** ``get``, ``get_result``, ``list_for_token`` and
      ``delete`` are scoped to the owning token; a wrong ``token_id``
      behaves exactly like a missing job (``None``/``False``), so job
      existence never leaks across tokens (the indistinguishable-404 rule).
    * **Guarded transitions.** The ``mark_*`` methods are compare-and-set:
      they apply only from the expected prior status and report ``False``
      otherwise — a late transition after a delete or a competing
      transition must be a no-op, never an upsert or an overwrite.
    * **Metadata/result split.** ``get`` and ``list_for_token`` return
      metadata-only :class:`Job` snapshots and must not read the stored
      content; the result blob is written by ``mark_done`` and read back
      only through ``get_result``, so status polling and listings never
      pay for stored text (it scales with result size, not job count).
